# Pybats Tutorials

## Let's Visualize SWMF Output!
Pybats is a module within the Spacepy python library for **reading, analyzing, and visualizing output files from the [Space Weather Modeling Framework](https://github.com/MSTEM-QUDA)**.  Its most basic function is to provide a python interface to SWMF output, but it's much more than that- create compound figures, extract stream traces, calculate fluxes, and more.

This repository contains a set of tutorials to get you started with Pybats.

## Required Libraries

To be able to run the same commands and scripts as contained within this tutorial, you will need Spacepy (which includes Pybats) and all of its dependencies.

The tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks.  If you want to be able to run them interactively, you'll need to obtain Jupyter on your machine.

Finally, the Jupytext plugin is used to synchronize the markdown and `*.ipynb` files.  You'll want to install this plugin if you are contributing to this repository.
